## üî• News

- Jan 21, 2025: üí¨ Release [Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2). Please give it a try!

## **Abstract**

We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.

## ‚òØÔ∏è **Hunyuan3D 2.0**

### Architecture

Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.

### Performance

We have evaluated Hunyuan3D 2.0 with other open-source as well as close-source 3d-generation methods.
The numerical results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 surpasses all baselines in the quality of generated textured 3D assets
and the condition following ability.

## ü§ó Get Started with Hunyuan3D 2.0

You may follow the next steps to use Hunyuan3D 2.0 via code or the Gradio App.

### Install Requirements

Please install Pytorch via the [official](https://pytorch.org/) site. Then install the other requirements via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# for texture
cd hy3dgen/texgen/custom_rasterizer
python3 setup.py install
cd hy3dgen/texgen/differentiable_renderer
bash compile_mesh_painter.sh
```

### API Usage

We designed a diffusers-like API to use our shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT and texture synthesis model -
Hunyuan3D-Paint.

You could assess **Hunyuan3D-DiT** via:

```python
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]
```

The output mesh is a [trimesh object](https://trimesh.org/trimesh.html), which you could save to glb/obj (or other
format) file.

For **Hunyuan3D-Paint**, do the following:

```python
from hy3dgen.texgen import Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

# let's generate a mesh first
pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]

pipeline = Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(mesh, image='assets/demo.png')
```

Please visit [minimal_demo.py](minimal_demo.py) for more advanced usage, such as **text to 3D** and **texture generation
for handcrafted mesh**.

### Gradio App

You could also host a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) App in your own computer via:

```bash
pip3 install gradio==3.39.0
python3 gradio_app.py
```

Don't forget to visit [Hunyuan3D](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com) for quick use, if you don't want to host yourself.
