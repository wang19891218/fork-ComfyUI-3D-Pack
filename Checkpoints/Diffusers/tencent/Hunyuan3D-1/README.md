## **Abstract**
<p align="center">

</p>

While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation.

In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure.

Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.

## ðŸ“ˆ Comparisons

We have evaluated Hunyuan3D-1.0 with other open-source 3d-generation methods, our Hunyuan3D-1.0 received the highest user preference across 5 metrics. Details in the picture on the lower left.

The lite model takes around 10 seconds to produce a 3D mesh from a single image on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, while the standard model takes roughly 25 seconds. The plot laid out in the lower right demonstrates that Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an optimal balance between quality and efficiency.

## Get Started

#### Begin by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tencent/Hunyuan3D-1
cd Hunyuan3D-1
```

#### Installation Guide for Linux

We provide an env_install.sh script file for setting up environment. 

```
# step 1, create conda env
conda create -n hunyuan3d-1 python=3.9 or 3.10 or 3.11 or 3.12
conda activate hunyuan3d-1

# step 2. install torch realated package
which pip # check pip corresponds to python

# modify the cuda version according to your machine (recommended)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# step 3. install other packages
bash env_install.sh
```

<summary>ðŸ’¡Other tips for envrionment installation</summary>
    
Optionally, you can install xformers or flash_attn to acclerate computation:

```
pip install xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
```
pip install flash_attn
```

Most environment errors are caused by a mismatch between machine and packages. You can try manually specifying the version, as shown in the following successful cases:
```
# python3.9
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 
```

when install pytorch3d, the gcc version is preferably greater than 9, and the gpu driver should not be too old.

#### Download Pretrained Models

The models are available at [https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan3D-1](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan3D-1):

+ `Hunyuan3D-1/lite`, lite model for multi-view generation.
+ `Hunyuan3D-1/std`, standard model for multi-view generation.
+ `Hunyuan3D-1/svrm`, sparse-view reconstruction model.


To download the model, first install the huggingface-cli. (Detailed instructions are available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli).)

```shell
python3 -m pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
```

Then download the model using the following commands:

```shell
mkdir weights
huggingface-cli download tencent/Hunyuan3D-1 --local-dir ./weights

mkdir weights/hunyuanDiT
huggingface-cli download Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.1-Diffusers-Distilled --local-dir ./weights/hunyuanDiT
```

#### Inference 
For text to 3d generation, we supports bilingual Chinese and English, you can use the following command to inference.
```python
python3 main.py \
    --text_prompt "a lovely rabbit" \
    --save_folder ./outputs/test/ \
    --max_faces_num 90000 \
    --do_texture_mapping \
    --do_render
```

For image to 3d generation, you can use the following command to inference.
```python
python3 main.py \
    --image_prompt "/path/to/your/image" \
    --save_folder ./outputs/test/ \
    --max_faces_num 90000 \
    --do_texture_mapping \
    --do_render
```
We list some more useful configurations for easy usage:

|    Argument        |  Default  |                     Description                     |
|:------------------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|`--text_prompt`  |   None    |The text prompt for 3D generation         |
|`--image_prompt` |   None    |The image prompt for 3D generation         |
|`--t2i_seed`     |    0      |The random seed for generating images        |
|`--t2i_steps`    |    25     |The number of steps for sampling of text to image  |
|`--gen_seed`     |    0      |The random seed for generating 3d generation        |
|`--gen_steps`    |    50     |The number of steps for sampling of 3d generation  |
|`--max_faces_numm` | 90000  |The limit number of faces of 3d mesh |
|`--save_memory`   | False   |module will move to cpu automatically|
|`--do_texture_mapping` |   False    |Change vertex shadding to texture shading  |
|`--do_render`  |   False   |render gif   |


We have also prepared scripts with different configurations for reference
- Inference Std-pipeline requires 30GB VRAM (24G VRAM with --save_memory).
- Inference Lite-pipeline requires 22GB VRAM (18G VRAM with --save_memory).
- Note: --save_memory will increase inference time

```bash
bash scripts/text_to_3d_std.sh 
bash scripts/text_to_3d_lite.sh 
bash scripts/image_to_3d_std.sh 
bash scripts/image_to_3d_lite.sh 
```

If your gpu memory is 16G, you can try to run modules in pipeline seperately:
```bash
bash scripts/text_to_3d_std_separately.sh 'a lovely rabbit' ./outputs/test # >= 16G
bash scripts/text_to_3d_lite_separately.sh 'a lovely rabbit' ./outputs/test # >= 14G
bash scripts/image_to_3d_std_separately.sh ./demos/example_000.png ./outputs/test  # >= 16G
bash scripts/image_to_3d_lite_separately.sh ./demos/example_000.png ./outputs/test # >= 10G
```

#### Using Gradio

We have prepared two versions of multi-view generation, std and lite.

```shell
# std 
python3 app.py
python3 app.py --save_memory

# lite
python3 app.py --use_lite
python3 app.py --use_lite --save_memory
```

Then the demo can be accessed through http://0.0.0.0:8080. It should be noted that the 0.0.0.0 here needs to be X.X.X.X with your server IP.

## Camera Parameters

Output views are a fixed set of camera poses:

+ Azimuth (relative to input view): `+0, +60, +120, +180, +240, +300`.
